```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lift.git
cd lift

# Install with pip
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize the database

```bash
lift init
```

This creates the database, loads 137 exercises, and sets up default configuration.

### 2. Start your first workout

```bash
lift workout start
```

Follow the interactive prompts to log sets for your exercises.

### 3. View your exercises

```bash
# List all exercises
lift exercises list

# Search for exercises
lift exercises search "bench"

# Filter by muscle group
lift exercises list --muscle Chest

# Filter by category
lift exercises list --category Push
```

### 4. Import sample programs

```bash
lift program import-samples
lift program list
lift program show "PPL 6-Day"
```

## Usage Guide

### Exercise Management

```bash
# List exercises with filters
lift exercises list --category Push --equipment Barbell

# Show exercise library statistics
lift exercises stats

# Get detailed exercise info
lift exercises info "Barbell Bench Press"

# Add a custom exercise
lift exercises add

# Delete custom exercise
lift exercises delete "My Custom Exercise"
```

### Workout Logging

```bash

#### Interactive Workout Session

During a workout session, you can log sets using these shortcuts:

- `185 10` ‚Üí 185 lbs √ó 10 reps
- `185 10 8.5` ‚Üí 185 lbs √ó 10 reps @ RPE 8.5
- `s` ‚Üí Same as previous set
- `+5` ‚Üí Add 5 lbs to previous weight
- `-5 8` ‚Üí Subtract 5 lbs, 8 reps
- `done` ‚Üí Finish current exercise

Example session:
```
Exercise: bench press
Set 1 > 185 10 8
‚úì 185 lbs √ó 10 reps @ RPE 8.0

Set 2 > s
‚úì 185 lbs √ó 10 reps @ RPE 8.0

Set 3 > +5 8 9
‚úì 190 lbs √ó 8 reps @ RPE 9.0

Set 4 > done
```

### Database schema

The database includes:
- **exercises** - Exercise library with metadata
- **workouts** - Workout sessions
- **sets** - Individual set logs
- **programs** - Training programs
- **program_workouts** - Workout templates
- **program_exercises** - Exercise prescriptions
- **personal_records** - PR tracking
- **body_measurements** - Body tracking data
- **settings** - Configuration

Plus analytical views for efficient querying:
- `workout_volume` - Volume per workout
- `weekly_muscle_volume` - Volume by muscle group per week
- `exercise_progression` - Exercise history with 1RM estimates
- `bodyweight_trend` - Weekly bodyweight averages

## Architecture

LIFT follows a clean architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
lift/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cli/           # CLI command groups (Typer)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/      # Business logic layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/          # Database and models (DuckDB, Pydantic)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/         # Utilities (calculations, formatters, charts)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/          # Seed data (exercises, programs)
```

### Technology Stack

- **Typer** - CLI framework with auto-completion
- **Rich** - Beautiful terminal output and formatting
- **DuckDB** - High-performance analytical database
- **Pydantic** - Data validation and serialization
- **Plotext** - Terminal-based charts and graphs
