**Weekly Totals:**
- Average Bodyweight: 186.6 lbs
- Total Volume: 86,000 lbs
- Total Training Time: 430 minutes (7.2 hours)
- Workouts Completed: 6/6

## Tips for Consistency

1. **Same time daily**: Track bodyweight at the same time (morning, after bathroom, before food)
2. **Log immediately**: Enter data right after each workout
3. **Weekly review**: Set aside 15-30 minutes every Sunday
4. **Adjust as needed**: If volume is too high/low, adjust next week
5. **Note how you feel**: Use the rating and notes fields

## Adjustments Based on Data

### If Bodyweight Is Dropping

- Increase calories
- Monitor strength - ensure not losing performance
- Consider reducing cardio

### If Bodyweight Is Climbing Too Fast

- Reduce surplus
- Ensure it's muscle not fat (use measurements)
- Check recovery quality

### If Volume Is Too High

- Fatigue accumulating
- Performance dropping
- Consider deload or reduce accessory work

### If Volume Is Too Low

- Not enough stimulus
- Could add sets to weak points
- Verify progressive overload is happening
